=begin
Write a program to determine whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.

An isosceles triangle has exactly two sides of the same length.

A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.

Note: For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides must be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
